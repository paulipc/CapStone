This is second major version of KN regressor prediction algorithm in Python.

Now I have separated train and predict functions to separate python files so these can be run separately, first train and then predict.

train function takes only one file as input from ./inputs directory and model is saved to ./outputs directory where predict function can find it as well as save predictions into same folder.
